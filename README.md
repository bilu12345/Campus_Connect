# Campus_Connect
Campus Connect is a full-stack MERN web application built to enhance communication and coordination within a college campus.
It connects students, faculty, and administrators on a single platform where they can share announcements, discuss topics, manage events, and stay updated with campus news.

The app uses React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend API, and MongoDB as the database.
It demonstrates key concepts like RESTful API design, JWT authentication, role-based access control, and dynamic single-page frontend rendering.
